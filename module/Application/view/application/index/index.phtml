        GiliStrong is an online-platform to manage the situation on all three Gili Islands. Business and Property owners
        should register their properties in the registration form. If you have multiple businesses, please register

        In the first stage, his platform helps architects/officials to identify buildings, which need to be checked for
        structural soundness. As the process of rebuilding proceeds, owners should continuously update their status on
        the platform. In a later stage, this information can then be used for tourists to identify places that are open
        for business.
